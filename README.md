# SEO-Keyword-Analysis
## Project Overview
This project was completed as part of my Data Analysis Masters course internship. The objective was to analyze SEO keywords to improve website traffic. The project involved data collection, database schema design, data preprocessing in Python, and visualization in Power BI.

## Technologies Used
•	MySQL: Database schema creation and query execution
•	Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn): Data preprocessing and exploratory analysis
•	Power BI: Visualization of keyword performance and traffic trends

## Project Workflow
1.	Database Schema Design (MySQL)
      o	Created an Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) for structured keyword storage
      o	Normalized data to reduce redundancy and improve query efficiency
2.	Data Preprocessing (Python)
      o	Imported raw keyword data
      o	Handled missing values, duplicates, and formatting issues
      o	Extracted key SEO metrics
3.	Data Analysis & Insights
      o	Analyzed keyword rankings, search volume, and click-through rates
      o	Identified high-performing and underperforming keywords
      o	Explored trends to optimize SEO strategy
4.	Visualization (Power BI)
      o	Developed an interactive SEO traffic dashboard
      o	Showcased keyword performance, traffic trends, and user engagement

## Challenges & Solutions
•	Complex Schema Design: Ensured normalization while maintaining relational integrity
•	EDA in Python: Cleared unnecessary columns and transformed data for better insights
•	Dashboard : Creating an interactive SEO traffic dashboard.

## Key Takeaways
